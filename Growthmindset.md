## What does Growth Mindset mean to me?

**Growth Mindset** to me means persurveering and being ok with failure in order to create a life long personal learning/growth enviornment. 
I will try to remeber to

1. Always be curious and willing to learn.
2. Rome wasnt built in a day
3. Failing means your trying and making progress
