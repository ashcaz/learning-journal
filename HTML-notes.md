## Chapter 1 Structure

**HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)**
- HTML describesprovides structure to web pages using code/tags
- tags act like containers. They tell you something about the information that lies between thier opening and closing tags
- tags plus content inbetween them = element

**Common Tags**

- body: conists of everything in the main browser window
- p: paragraph
- h1:  Header tags go from 1-6 denoting headings and sub-headings
- head: before the body element contains information about the page but usually isnt seen on the page
- title:  what shows in the browser tab

- tags can also have attributes ex. p lang (attribute name)= "en-us" (attribute vale)

Chrome > View > Developer > View Source (option + command + u) - allows you to view code for websites you are visitng
