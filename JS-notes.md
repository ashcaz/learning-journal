## Dynamic Web Pages With Javascript

- javascript file uses .js extension
- script element is used in HTML pages to tell the browser to load the JavasScript file

### Basic JavaScript Instructions

- a **script** is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. 
- Each individual instruction or step is known as a **statement**.
    - Statements should always end in a semicolon.
    - Statements are instructions and each one starts with a new line
    - JavaScript is case sensitive
    - Statements are surrounded by curly braces {}; these are known as code blocks
- You should write **comments** to explain what code does 
    - // single line comment in js (gray)
    - /* Multi-line comment */ (pink)

**Variables** 

- Variables are used by scripts to temporarily store information
- Before you can use a variable you need to annouce that you want to use it

    var quantity;

- var = variable keyword
    - in order to use a variable you have to give it a name, which is sometimes called an identifier 
- quantity = variable name
    - if varable name is more than one word its usually written in **camelCase**
- Once you've created a variable, you can tell it what information you would like it to store for you aka assigning a value

    quantity = 3

- equal sign is the assignment operator it says that youre going to assign a value to the variable
- 3 is the varibale value. Until you assign a value the value is undifined

**Data Types**

- **Numeric** data type: handles numbers
- **String** data type: consists of letters and other characters 
    - strings must always be written on one line
- **Boolean** data types: can have one of two values: true or false

**Rules For Naming Varibles**

1. The name must begin with a letter, a dollar sign($) or an underscore (_). It must not start with a number
2. The name can contain letters, numbers, dollars sign or an underscore. You may not use a dash (-) or a period (.)ina varibable name.
3. You can not use keywords or reserved words
4. All variables are case sensitive.
5. Use a name that describes the kind of information that the variable stores
6. If your variable name is made up of more than one word, use a capital letter for the second word and and other word after.
