### What does Growth Mindset mean to me?

**Growth Mindset** to me means persurveering and being ok with failure in order to create a life long personal learning/growth enviornment. 
I will try to remeber to

1. Always be curious and willing to learn.
2. Rome wasnt built in a day
3. Failing means your trying and making progress




You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/ashcaz/learning-journal/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ashcaz/learning-journal/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
