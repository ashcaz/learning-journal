### What is a Script and how do I create one?

- A script is a series of instructions that computer can follow to achieve a goal
    - scripts can be compared to recipes, handbooks, or manuals
- To write a script, you need to first state your goal, then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it
- start with e big picture and break it down into smaller steps
    1. define the goal
    2. design the script
    3. code each step

### Designing a Script

**Tasks**

- Once you know the goal of the script, you can work out the individual tasks needed to achieve it
- Use flowcharts for high-level view

**Steps**

- Each individual task may be broken down into steps
- When all the steps are figured out those steps can be translated into code

**From Steps to Code**

- Every step for every task in a flowchart needs to be written in a language the computer can understand
- Just like learning any new language you need to grasp 
    1. **Vocabulary** : The words the computer understands
    2. **Syntax** : How to put those words  together to create instructions computers can follow
- Computers solve problems pogrammatically meaning they follow a series of instructions, one after the other

**Expressions**

- An **Expression** evaluates into (results in) a single value
- There are two types of expressions
    1. Expressions that just assign a value to a variable
        
        var color = 'beige';

    2. Expressions that use two or more values to return a single value

        var area = 3*2;

**Operators**

- Expressions rely on operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values
    - Assignment operators

        color = 'beige';

    - Arithmetic Operators

        area = 3 * 2;

    - String Operators

        greeting = 'Hi ' + 'Molly';

    - Comparison Operators

        buy = 3 > 5;

    - Logical Operators

        buy = (5 > 3) && (2 < 4)
