## Programming with JavaScript

JavaScript is what allows you to make websites more interavtive

### What is a Script and how do I create one?

- A script is a series of instructions that computer can follow to achieve a goal
    - scripts can be compared to recipes, handbooks, or manuals
- To write a script, you need to first state your goal, then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it
- start with e big picture and break it down into smaller steps
    1. define the goal
    2. design the script
    3. code each step

### Designing a Script

**Tasks**

- Once you know the goal of the script, you can work out the individual tasks needed to achieve it
- Use flowcharts for high-level view

**Steps**

- Each individual task may be broken down into steps
- When all the steps are figured out those steps can be translated into code

**From Steps to Code**

- Every step for every task in a flowchart needs to be written in a language the computer can understand
- Just like learning any new language you need to grasp 
    1. **Vocabulary** : The words the computer understands
    2. **Syntax** : How to put those words  together to create instructions computers can follow
- Computers solve problems pogrammatically meaning they follow a series of instructions, one after the other

**Expressions**

- An **Expression** evaluates into (results in) a single value
- There are two types of expressions
    1. Expressions that just assign a value to a variable
        
        var color = 'beige';

    2. Expressions that use two or more values to return a single value

        var area = 3*2;

**Operators**

- Expressions rely on operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values
    - Assignment operators

        color = 'beige';

    - Arithmetic Operators

        area = 3 * 2;

    - String Operators

        greeting = 'Hi ' + 'Molly';

    - Comparison Operators

        buy = 3 > 5;

    - Logical Operators

        buy = (5 > 3) && (2 < 4)

**Arithmetic Operator**

- Addition (+) adds another value
- Subtraction (-) subtracts one value from another
- Divison (/) divides two values
- Multiplication (*) Multiples two values
- Increment (++) adds one to the current number
- Decrement (--) subtracts one from the current number
- Modulus (%) divides two values and returns the remainder

**String Operator**

- there is only one string operator : the + symbol
- the process of joining two or more strings to create one new string is called **concatenation**

**Functions**

- A **function** is a group or series of statements together that perform a certain task
- Functions are not always executed when the page loads. When you ask it to perform a task, its known as **calling the function**
- Some functions need to be provided with information in order to complete the task. A function that gives you an area needs to be provided with a height and width. The pieces of information passed are called **parameters**
- When you write a function and you expect it to provide you with a response, the reponse is called a **return value**
- To create a function you have to give it a name and then write the statements need to achieve the task in curly braces.

''function sayHello (){
    document.write('Hello!');
}''
